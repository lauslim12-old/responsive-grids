# Responsive Grid System
Responsive grids - inspiration by Jonas Schmedtmann's course.

## Architecture / Philosophies
- No Bootstrap or any other frameworks used. This is pure Sassy Cascading Style Sheets!
- Usage of Sassy CSS (SCSS)
- Block Element Modifier Naming System
- Think, Build, Architect Thinking Philosophy
- Responsive Design
- Standard UI Design Procedures
- Coded with Visual Studio Code

## Overview
- There are three grid systems that would be updated here: Float Layout, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.
- For now, only the Float Layout and the CSS Grid Layout are available.

### Float Layouts
- Usage of width, floats, and clearfix hacks in order to make a responsive grid system.

### Flexbox Layouts
- Usage of flexbox to make layouts easier. The design is pretty similar to the Float Layouts.

### CSS Grid
- The design is a blog-like website, but only the grids that are available.

## Usage
- First, clone this repository by using `git clone repository_link`.
- Next, run `npm i` to install the SASS compiler.
- Choose one of the NPM scripts to run: `float:watch:sass`, `flex:watch:sass` or `grid:watch:sass`.
- Every time you change your SASS file, it should be compiled to CSS immediately.
- I intentionally ignored the CSS files to reduce clutter.

Alternatively, run it on `codepen.io` by copy pasting the HTML and the SCSS code.
