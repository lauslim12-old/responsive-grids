# Architecture / Philosophies

- Usage of Sassy CSS (SCSS)
- Block Element Modifier Naming System
- Think, Build, Architect Thinking Philosophy
- Responsive Design
- Standard UI Design Procedures

# Overview
- There are three grid systems that would be updated here: Float Layout, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.
- For now, only the Float Layout and the CSS Grid Layout are available.

## Detailed Overview - Float Layouts
- Usage of width, floats, and clearfix hacks in order to make a responsive grid system.

## Detailed Overview - CSS Grid
- The design is a blog-like website, but only the grids that are available.

# Usage
- Initialize with `npm install`.
- Don't forget to `npm install node-sass` because you will need the SCSS code.
- Copy and paste the required columns into your project.
- Compile the code with `node:sass '.scss-file-location' 'css-output'.
- Look at the results.

Alternatively, run it on `codepen.io` by copy pasting the HTML and the SCSS code.
