# Responsive Grid System
Responsive grids - inspiration by Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course.

# Architecture / Philosophies
- No Bootstrap or any other frameworks used. This is pure Sassy Cascading Style Sheets!
- Usage of Sassy CSS (SCSS)
- Block Element Modifier Naming System
- Think, Build, Architect Thinking Philosophy
- Responsive Design
- Standard UI Design Procedures
- Coded with Visual Studio Code

# Overview
- There are three grid systems that would be updated here: Float Layout, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.
- The grids are colored with gradients to make it easier on the eyes.
- For now, only the Float Layout is available, and it is not responsive yet. Kinda responsive, but not 100% responsive.

# Usage
- Initialize with `npm install`.
- Don't forget to `npm install node-sass` because you will need the SCSS code.
- Copy and paste the required columns into your project.
- Compile the code with `node:sass '.scss-file-location' 'css-output'.
- Look at the results.
